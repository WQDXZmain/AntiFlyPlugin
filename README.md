# AntiFlyPlugin
I was interested in creating a plugin for the Minecraft server that restricts players from using the cheat functions for flight, but I don't understand this area at all, so I asked to write code from Chat GPT. If it's not difficult, please help me compile the following code into a jar file, or write this small plugin for me manually. Thanks!
